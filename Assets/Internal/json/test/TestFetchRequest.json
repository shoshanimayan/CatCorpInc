I've spent the last few months working a presentation to try to convince the company to reduce the amount of child laborers we use in the production of our products, it's probably not great for public relations and it feels just wrong!\n I've been trying to get Lloyd Pawwings to share his research data on the effects of child labor on our product and customer opinions, but he's being pretty stubborn about it, could you talk to him and try to get that data for me?"
